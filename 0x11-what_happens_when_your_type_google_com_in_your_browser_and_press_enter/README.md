# What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com in Your Browser and Press Enter

When you type https://www.google.com in your browser and press Enter, a series of complex events occurs to deliver the desired webpage to your screen. This process involves multiple systems and protocols working together seamlessly. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of each step:

## 1. DNS Request
The Domain Name System (DNS) is the internet's directory. When you enter a URL, the browser needs to translate it into an IP address, which is the unique identifier for a web server.

- **Browser Cache**: First, the browser checks its cache to see if it has recently requested the IP address for www.google.com.
- **Operating System Cache**: If not found in the browser, the request goes to the operating system's cache.
- **Router Cache**: If still not found, the request moves to the router's cache.
- **ISP DNS Server**: Finally, if none of the caches contain the IP address, the request is sent to the ISP's DNS server. If the ISP's DNS server doesn't have the IP address, it will perform a recursive search, querying other DNS servers until it finds the correct IP address.

## 2. TCP/IP
Once the IP address is obtained, the browser establishes a connection to the server using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP).

- **TCP Handshake**: The browser initiates a TCP connection using a three-step process known as the TCP handshake:
  - **SYN**: The client sends a synchronization packet to the server.
  - **SYN-ACK**: The server responds with a synchronization-acknowledgment packet.
  - **ACK**: The client sends an acknowledgment packet back to the server, and the connection is established.

## 3. Firewall
During the TCP handshake, firewalls on both the client and server sides ensure that only legitimate traffic is allowed through. Firewalls protect the network from malicious traffic and unauthorized access. The request passes through the firewall that accepts traffic on port TCP/443 (HTTPS).

## 4. HTTPS/SSL
Since the URL uses HTTPS, the connection needs to be secure. This is where SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) comes into play.

- **SSL Handshake**: The client and server perform an SSL handshake to establish a secure connection:
  - **Client Hello**: The client sends a message proposing cipher settings, the SSL/TLS version, and other information.
  - **Server Hello**: The server responds with the chosen cipher suite, SSL/TLS version, and its SSL certificate.
  - **Certificate Verification**: The client verifies the server's certificate against a list of trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs).
  - **Session Keys**: Both the client and server generate session keys to encrypt subsequent communications.

## 5. Load Balancer
Once the secure connection is established, the request may pass through a load balancer. Load balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed. This improves responsiveness and reliability.

## 6. Web Server
The load balancer forwards the request to one of the web servers. The web server is responsible for handling the HTTP request. It may serve static content directly or pass the request to an application server for dynamic content.

## 7. Application Server
If dynamic content is required (e.g., search results), the web server forwards the request to an application server. The application server runs the necessary code, processes the request, and interacts with other backend components if needed. The application server will generate the page.

## 8. Database
In many cases, the application server will query a database to retrieve or store data. The database server processes these queries and returns the requested data to the application server.

## Final Steps
1. **Response Assembly**: The application server assembles the response, possibly with data from the database, and sends it back to the web server.
2. **Sending Data Back**: The web server sends the assembled response back through the load balancer.
3. **SSL Decryption**: The response travels back through the SSL/TLS layer, where it is decrypted.
4. **TCP/IP Transmission**: The decrypted data is sent back to the client over the established TCP/IP connection.
5. **Browser Rendering**: Finally, the browser receives the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript content, parses it, and renders the webpage for you to see and interact with.

## Conclusion
This entire process, from typing the URL to seeing the webpage, occurs in a matter of seconds. Understanding these steps provides insight into the complexity and efficiency of modern web technologies and the importance of each component in delivering a seamless browsing experience.
